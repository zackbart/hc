## Development Notes

This theme was developed with a focus on creating a unique aesthetic that explores the tension between Bauhaus modernist principles and WW2-era monumental design. The development process involved extensive iteration on typography, color schemes, and layout systems to achieve the desired "dissonant harmony" effect.

The project evolved from experimental multi-theme variations to a focused single-theme implementation optimized for the Astro ecosystem and theme submission requirements.
